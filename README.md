# Lets Get Climbing!
Lets get Climbing is a page for people who want to begin or already are climbing that want to join a community of trained and certified instrucotors to help them advance or possibly go on trips with. Climbing trips take quite a bit of logistics so by creating a page that hosts communal climbing events it takes the pressure off and people can just show up as they want.

## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
  - Two warnings were present that belonged to different code.
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
  - A singular warning.

- WAVE
 - with a few constast errors that due to layout came about, most came from imported code.

### Unfixed Bugs

A problem I had was in Responsiveness, where I couldnt mold the technology to fit into my smaller screen designs due to how i laid out the project, with slightly better knowledge or more time I could figure it out, but just making everything fit onto the screen was a challenge for me. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - Going through the repository I went into settings and went to the page section.
  - I then selected the main branch and created a domain name of Lets Get Climbing!
  You can find it at this url ()


## Credits 

- I used Love Running as an inspiration and I used guidance from my mentor to give me help with certain coding features. I watched the Love running videos to try implementing features and then changing them to my needs as I saw fit.
- I also looked at other climbing websites to see what they offer and what I could possible achieve.
